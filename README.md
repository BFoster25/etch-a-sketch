# etch-a-sketch

Etch-a-Sketch Project from "The Odin Project"

I somewhat deviated from this project's instructions. Instead of doing a "classic" etch-a-sketch of grey/black squares, I decided to make it more vibrant by randomizing the color of each square when you drag the mouse over it. As you pass through each square again, each of the RGB values get 10% darker with each pass through until RGB value is 0,0,0 (completely black).

I also provided a Range Slider to give the user the option to change the grid size, from 1x1 to 100x100.

The "Multicolor" text color is also randomized whenever the page refreshes.

The main purpose of this project was to get more familiar with DOM Manipulation, much like the Rock Paper Scissors project. More CSS was utilized with this project.
